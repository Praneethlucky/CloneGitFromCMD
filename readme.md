This runs via command prompt to clone multiple repositories from any repository hub like GitHub, BitBucket etc., at once.
This clones all the repositories at once in a single folder and skips if already exists in your local.
So running this multiple times will not cause any blocker to existing repositories in your local.

To Run this:
Step 1 - Add repositories list in single line in the repos.txt file
Step 2 - Run CloneAllBat from your command prompt and input the GitHub base location and path to the folder where you want them to be cloned.
Now wait and watch, it clones all the repositories, if any failure happens it gives you list and similarly gives you existing repos list and cloned list
